**DISCLAIMER**: I don't know if private threads will work for boosted servers, so if they don't, please join the support server and tell me.
Also don't change the name of the support ticket, the bot won't be able to close the ticket properly

1. Give the bot all thread permissions and manage messages if it doesn't have it.
2. Add the managers via `ticket-config managers {role}`.
3. Create a text channel named `support`, or specify a channel via `ticket-config support-channel {channel}`.
