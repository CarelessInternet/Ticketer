**DISCLAIMER**: I don't know if private threads will work for boosted servers, so if they don't, please join the support server and tell me.
Also don't change the name of the thread channel, the bot won't be able to close the channel

1. Create a text channel named #support.
2. Add the managers via `ticket-config`.
