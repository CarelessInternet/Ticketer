# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose

# Run this to start the database and bot:
# docker compose --env-file ./.env.database.production.local --env-file ./.env.bot.production.local -f compose.yaml up -d

# Run this to deploy the commands:
# docker exec ticketer-bot sh -c "cd /src/apps/bot && pnpm commands:deploy:production"

# Run this to rebuild the images from scratch (useful after changes from the codebase):
# docker compose build --no-cache

# Run the following line to access the database's terminal and the line after to access the database (change username accordingly).
# docker exec -it ticketer-database bash
# mariadb -u USERNAME -p
