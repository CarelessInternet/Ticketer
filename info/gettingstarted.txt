**DISCLAIMER**: I don't know if private threads will work for boosted servers, so if they don't, please join the support server and tell me.
Also don't change the name of the support ticket, the bot won't be able to close the ticket properly

1. Create a text channel named #support.
2. Add the managers via `ticket-config`.
